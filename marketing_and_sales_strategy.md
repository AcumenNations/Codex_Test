# Marketing and Sales Strategy

## Promotion
- **Weekly Live Shows** – Scheduled “Palm Street Plant Hour” on TikTok and Instagram with top-down camera, voice-over and on-screen pricing.
- **Faceless Short Clips** – Repurpose stream highlights into 15-second reels for discovery.
- **QR-coded Flyers** – Posted on nearby coffee shops and laundromats directing pedestrians to streams and lockers.
- **Referral Program** – Existing customers get discount codes when friends purchase via live shows.

## Sales Channels
1. **Livestream Checkout** – Viewers comment to claim items; invoices sent via mobile payment apps.
2. **Pop-up Cart** – Occasional weekend cart on Palm Street featuring leftover inventory to reduce storage costs.
3. **Subscriptions** – Monthly care boxes auto-billed through e-commerce platform.
4. **Corporate Gifting** – Outreach to property managers and small offices for bulk orders.

## Customer Retention
- After delivery, buyers receive a care text with a link to a faceless tip video.
- Optional “Plant SOS” hotline (handled by chat assistant) provides troubleshooting to reduce returns.

These tactics leverage overlooked channels like lockers and QR flyers while keeping marketing spend low.
