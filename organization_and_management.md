# Organization and Management

Palm Street Plants begins as a solo operation with scalable contractor support.

## Owner
- **Founder/Host** – sources inventory, scripts shows, manages finances and voice-over during live streams.

## Contractors
- **Virtual Chat Assistant** – remote worker handles real-time questions during shows to keep the host off-camera.
- **Bike Couriers** – gig cyclists deliver within the local radius.
- **Horticulture Consultant** – part-time expert verifies plant health and provides care tips for subscribers.

To maintain anonymity, all on-screen hands wear branded gloves and the studio uses overhead rigs. As sales grow, roles such as inventory manager or additional hosts can be added while keeping the faceless format.
