# Executive Summary

Palm Street Plants is a micro-retail venture that sells curated houseplants through faceless, QVC-style live streams shot from a small studio on Palm Street. Customers watch overhead, voice-over demonstrations on TikTok and Instagram, then purchase for local pickup or same-day delivery.

The indoor plant market reached $19.43 billion in 2023 and is projected to grow to $29.89 billion by 2032, driven by wellness and home-office trends.[^1] At the same time, livestream e-commerce is forecast to surge from $14.93 billion in 2024 to $258.76 billion by 2034.[^2] The convergence of these trends creates a low-cost opportunity to sell plants without a physical storefront.

**Vision**  
Become the go-to plant source for urban renters and home-office workers who prefer anonymous, hands-only presentations and rapid fulfillment.

**Strategy Highlights**
1. QVC-style, faceless live shows featuring gloved hands and top-down shots to maintain privacy while keeping attention on plants.
2. Limited-batch inventory sourced from regional growers and rotated weekly to create scarcity.
3. Local delivery by bicycle and a 24-hour “plant locker” for after-hours pickup—an overlooked convenience in the category.
4. Optional care subscriptions and self-watering pot bundles that smooth recurring revenue.

**Funding Need**  
The venture seeks $25,000 to cover initial inventory, climate-controlled storage, filming equipment and marketing.
