# Company Description

**Business Name:** Palm Street Plants  
**Location:** A 200 sq ft studio on Palm Street converted into a micro-warehouse and filming space.

Palm Street Plants combines local plant sourcing with live-commerce sales. The founder curates easy-care species—pothos, snake plants, rare cuttings—and demonstrates them via scripted, faceless live videos. Orders are packed off camera and delivered within a 5-mile radius.

**Mission**  
Make plant ownership approachable and entertaining while protecting the presenter’s anonymity.

**Legal Structure**  
Single-member LLC to simplify taxes and protect personal assets.

**Value Proposition**
- Anonymous QVC-style presentations focus attention on plant quality, not personality.  
- Same-day local delivery or secure locker pickup.  
- Optional monthly care plan where subscribers receive fertilizer, soil refreshers and seasonal tips.

**Long-Term Goal**  
Expand locker network across neighboring streets and license the faceless show format to other micro-sellers.
